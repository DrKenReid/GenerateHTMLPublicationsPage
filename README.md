This works in 3 steps.

<ol>
    <li> Set up author names for parameters</li>
    <li> Setup biopython if you don't have it, then run the scrape.</li>
    <li> Remove non-unique entries</li>
    <li> Write the HTML page (this is customised for www.msuqg.github.io but can be easily modified for your own usage). </li>
</ol>
